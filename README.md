# Euler Project: Problem 3

 The challenge presented was:

  What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

To tackle this I created a method that list the first 1000 prime numbers. I then tested if each prime was a divisor of 600851475143 and pushed it into an array if it was

From there you can find the max of the array to find your answer.
